### Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* LAB 2
  
  Lab 2 was one of my favorite labs because it was one where I felt like I was learning to code. As someone relatively new to the world of C++, diving into this lab was both thrilling and enlightening, offering a glimpse into the potential of my future projects. During this lab, I learned more about the concept of strings and their applications in programming. The main objective of this lab was to craft a program that prompts users to input words, assembling them into a paragraph similar to the game Mad Libs. With this lab, I became more familiar with the basic operations of git and Github. I also learned about line wrapping and parts of C++ formatting. By the end of the lab, I had mastered basic code and successfully operated the process of pushing my work onto GitHub.

* LAB 7
  
  Another favorite Lab was Lab 7. This is because it was one of the first labs that struck me. I've always been drawn to tasks that push me beyond my comfort zone, and this lab certainly did not disappoint. The main objective of this lab was to develop functions capable of accurately determining parking permissions on designated streets at specific times based on the provided regulations. Through this lab, I gained experience validating command-line inputs and effectively implementing domain logic using compound Boolean expressions within if statements.

* LAB 9 Part 2:

  Lab 9 was fun to work with, especially part 2. Part 2's main objective was to implement a guessing game with two programs, secret and game, where the secret number is hidden in a file. This part interested me because I grew up with 4 siblings and we played a lot of video games so I do have a special place for that hobby. Through this lab I had a small taste of game development concepts such as player interaction dn gameplay mechanics. During this lab I was able to learn more about File I/O operations in C++ for reading from and writing to files. I also learned more about handling errors.
